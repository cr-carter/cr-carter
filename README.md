<p>
  I'm an experienced Information Systems Supervisor currently serving in the military, previously serving as a System and Network Administrator. I have a Master's in Cybersecurity, and I hold multiple industry certifications, such as CySA+, Pentest+, CASP+ (SecurityX), SSCP, CCSP, CISSP, and ITIL. My career goal is to specialize in cyber security. To reach this goal, I am furthering working to expand my knowledge of various scripting and programming languages: Python, Powershell, and Bash. I am concurrently preparing for additional certifications such as CISM.

<h2>
  Objective
</h2>

<p>
  When I was in secondary school, I had a major interest in computer science. I learned the basics of Java, Python, and C. After graduation, I decided I was better suited to system and network administration. It was while I was working as a system/network administrator that I developed a passion for securing computer networks and systems, and I set a goal to pursue a role as a Cyber Capabilities Developer. Other roles I am interested in include Information Systems Engineer, Cyberspace Defense Technician, and Computer Network Operations Developer.
