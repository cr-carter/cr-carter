I'm an experienced System and Network Administrator currently serving in the military. I have a Master's in Cybersecurity, and I hold multiple industry certifications, such as CySA+, Pentest+, CASP+, SSCP, CCSP, and ITIL. My career goal is to specialize in cyber security. To reach this goal, I am furthering working to expand my knowledge of various scripting and programming languages: Python, Powershell, and Bash. I am concurrently preparing for additional certifications such as CISSP and CISM.

## Objective

When I was in secondary school, I had a major interest in computer science. I learned the basics of Java, Python, and C. After graduation, I decided I was better suited to system and network administration. It was while I was working as a system/network administrator that I developed a passion for securing computer networks, and I set a goal to pursue a role as a Cyber Capabilities Developer. Other roles I am interested in include Information Systems Engineer, Cyberspace Defense Technician, and Computer Network Operations Developer.

I am currently working through a Python course on Udemy, "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp" by Dr. Angela Yu. You can follow my progress in this repository: https://github.com/cr-carter/100-Day-of-Code-The-Complete-Python-Pro-Bootcamp.
