I'm an experienced System and Network Administrator currently serving in the military. I have a Bachelor's in Cybersecurity, and I hold multiple industry certifications, such as Sec+, CySA+, Pentest+, SSCP, and ITIL. My career goal is to specialize in cyber security. To reach this goal, I am furthering my education by pursuing a Master's in Cybersecurity, while concurrently preparing for additional certifications such as CCSP, CASP+, and CISM.
